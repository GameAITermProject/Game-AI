# Characteristic Enemy AI #


## Problem Statement ##
In most games, behaviors of enemy AI are monotonous. Usually after they spot enemy (i.e. player), they find path and then rush to the enemy, keep attacking until the enemy or itself dies. Fighting to death sounds honorable, but obviously is not intelligent and realistic. 
In a more realistic situation, the AI is expected to find whether they can beat their enemy, and can choose whether to keep attacking or running for lives based on current situation (e.g. its current health point, enemy's attack points). Furthermore, the AI should have better ways of fighting

## Techniques Involved ##
For the most basic, the AI should own the ability of evaluating the chance whether it can beat the enemy, which the Bayesian Network could be applied.
